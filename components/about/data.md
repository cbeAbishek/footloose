Footloose Edwin's Dance Company - Our Story
Company History
Footloose Edwin's Dance School was established in 1992 by Mr. M. Edwin in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu, marking the beginning of Coimbatore's first Western dance school. What started as a passionate dream to make dance accessible and exciting for everyone has grown into a comprehensive dance and entertainment company serving communities across Tamil Nadu and beyond.​​

Over the past 33 years (as of 2025), Footloose has trained more than 300,000 students and performed over 8,000 shows in India and abroad. From small birthday party performances to grand annual day celebrations, the company has consistently created immersive themed experiences that transport audiences to different worlds through the power of dance.​

Edwin, an engineer by past profession, transformed his passion for dance and choreography into a life's mission dedicated to inspiring creativity and lifelong learning through engaging, hands-on dance experiences. His dedication to dance has been inspiring to artists across the world, establishing Footloose as a cultural institution in Coimbatore.​

The school celebrates milestone anniversaries including its 30th Year Annual Day Event in 2025 with the theme "One Show, Infinite Experiences" - bringing dance art forms from different countries to Indian audiences.​
